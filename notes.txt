Notes from Joseph on analaysis 10/4/2024

Look at empathy/intonation study to see what they did to find overall utterance pitch height.

Get Pitch for boundary tone.

Bayesian to look for null finding. We think a meaningful difference would lie between these ranges. brm(). 

log --> z scores. 0,1.
f0 ~ politeness_condition + (1 + condition | participant) 
intercept => (power) =NORMAL mean 0, sd 1
		B (social distance) =NORMAL mean 0, sd .5

Random effects SD = cauchy(0,1)
		COR =	lkj(1)

Cristian decanio --> data available, how to do transformations, how to get f0.
	raw pitch --> z-scores

DATA ANALYSIS OPTION 2
F0 ~ 0 + politeness_condition + (1 + condition | participant)
