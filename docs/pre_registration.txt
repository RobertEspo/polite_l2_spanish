# Study Information

## Hypotheses
Research Question 1: Is boundary tone pitch height in L2 Spanish requests modulated by politeness (Ohala 1983)?
Hypothesis: Boundary tone pitch height will be modulated in L2 Spanish requests will be modulated by politeness such that higher levels of politeness (indicated by the + values of the politeness factors Power, Social Distance, and Level of Imposition) will induce higher boundary tone pitch heights.

Research Question 2: Will mean pitch of the utterance in L2 Spanish be modulated by politeness (Ohala 1983)?
Hypothesis: Mean pitch height of utterance in L2 Spanish requests will be modulated by politeness such that higher levels of politeness (indicated by the + values of the politeness factors Power, Social Distance, and Level of Imposition) will induce higher mean pitch height.

# Design Plan

## Study type
Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, “natural experiments,” and regression discontinuity designs.

## Blinding
No blinding is involved in this study.

## Is there any additional blinding in this study?
There is no additional blinding in this study.

##  Study design
This study consists of three tasks, given in the following order: a discourse completion task (DCT), followed by the LexTALE, and, finally, a language-experience questionnaire.

In the DCT, participants will be exposed to 24 scenarios with 8 conditions (3 scenarios per condition), controlled for +/- Power, +/- Social Distance, and +/- Level of Imposition of Request (Brown & Levinson 1987). Participants will respond to each scenario orally as naturally as possible.

The LexTALE task (Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2012) is a lexical decision experiment in which the participants are presented real and nonsense words. 
We will administer the Spanish version, LexTALE-ESP (Izura, Cuetos, & Brysbaert, 2014). 
Participants have to decide if the word they are presented is real or not using the keyboard ('1' for real, '0' for fake). 
The purpose of the LexTALE task is to get an assessment of the participants' vocabulary size in Spanish, which is assumed to be a proxy for Spanish proficiency. 
The LexTALE task takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. 

Finally, participants will complete a language-experience questionnaire that will request data on when they started learning Spanish, if they have study abroad experience, their age, and gender. The language-experience questionnaire takes approximately 3 minutes to complete. 

## Randomization

Scenarios for the DCT task will be presented randomly to participants. Each scenario will be assigned a number. In R, the function sample() will be used to place them in a random order for each participant.

# Sampling Plan

## Existing data
We do not have exisiting data.

## Explanation of existing data
N/A.

## Data collection procedures
We will collect 15 human participants for the study.
Participants will be adult native speakers of english with mid- to high-proficiency levels of Spanish (determined by the LexTALE task).
Participants will be recruited from undergraduate Spanish-language classes at Rutgers University. They will receive course credit for participating in this study.

## Sample size
All participants will be native speakers of American English with mid- to high-proficiency levels of Spanish.
All participants with knowledge of Spanish will be second language learners, operationally defined as having begun learning Spanish after the age of 13.
We plan to collect data from 15 individuals.

## Sample size rationale

## Stopping rule
We will stop data collection once a total of 15 participants have completed all tasks.

# Variables

## Manipulated variables
Our experiment will manipulate a "conditional" variable that refers to three independent factors described in Brown & Levinson (1987): Power, Social Distance, and Level of Imposition of Request. These values can be + or -. For example, [+Power] indicates that the Hearer has more power (e.g. the listener, who is a student, speaking to a professor).

## Measured variables
For the DCT, there are two measured variables: utterance-level mean pitch height and boundary tone height.

	***GOING TO WRITE SCRIPTS FOR THESE TWO PROCESSES***

To get "utterance-level mean pitch height", Praat's "Get Pitch" function will be used. The selection will be the entire length of the utterance.

To get "mean pitch height", in Praat, the final syllable of the utterance will be selected and the "Move cursor to maximum pitch" function will be used. Then, the "Get pitch" function will be used.

# Analysis Plan

## Statistical models

## Transformations
The raw F0 data will be extracted in Hz, and then converted to semitones. Then, z-scores will be computed (mean = 0, sd = 1).

## Inferences criteria

## Data exclusion
We will exclude data acording to the following criteria:

- Error during data collection
- Clear lack of understanding/engagement during the task, i.e., giving a completely irrelevant response to the DCT.

## Missing data

## Exploratory analysis
