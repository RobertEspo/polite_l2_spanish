Notes from Joseph on analaysis 10/4/2024

Look at empathy/intonation study to see what they did to find overall utterance pitch height.

Get Pitch for boundary tone.

Bayesian to look for null finding. We think a meaningful difference would lie between these ranges. brm().

Pitch --> semitones/log normalization --> z score
